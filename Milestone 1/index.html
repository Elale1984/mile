            Hello World! My name is Edward and I welcome you to my personal
            space. Here you can find some of the projects that I have completed.
            It is important to keep track of the work that we do and show the
            world what we are capable of. I came from an interesting and
            adventurous background. Life is full of surprises, but it is no
            surprise that I have ended up here. While I was in high school, I
            fell in love with computers and writing code.
          </p>

            It became a passion that I unfortunately did not pursue after
            graduation. But, like life does, a full circle has completed, and I
            am pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in Software Development. Technology
            has advanced at such a rapid rate that the things we can do now were
            not even dreamt of 5 years ago. I cant wait to see what the future
            holds in technological advances and I am excited to be a part of
            that exponential growth!
