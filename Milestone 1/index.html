        Hello World! My name is Edward and I welcome you to my personal space. Here you can
        find some of the projects that I have completed. It is important to keep track of
        the work that we do and show the world what we are capable of. I came from an interesting
        and adventurous background. Life is full of surprises, but it is no surprise that I have
        ended up here. While I was in high school, I fell in love with computers and writing code.
        It became a passion that I unfortunately did not pursue after graduation. But, like life does,
        a full circle has completed, and I am pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in Software Development.
        Technology has advanced at such a rapid rate that the things we can do now were not even
        dreamt of 5 years ago. I cant wait to see what the future holds in technological advances
        and I am excited to be a part of that exponential growth!
    </p>
