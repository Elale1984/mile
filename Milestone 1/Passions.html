        The main focus in my life, or at least I strive for it to be, is my Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ!
        My best friend, Jordan and I, were given a ministry a few years ago and God has led us
        to do many different works in it. We have done some full length talk shows teaching those who
        would listen about Biblical topics. We have also been blessed with the tasks of smaller, more focused
        messages concerning things like salvation, current event, and much more.

        For many years, I have been a student of music. I have played shows from street corners to large-scale music
        festivals with thousands in attendance. But all of that pales in comparison to little creative spurts of
        outpourings of creative flows that no one sees. That time where I am alone and just singing and playing unto the
        Lord.
        Here is one of those precious times!
